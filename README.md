## About me

Hi, I'm hzhao. A C++/C/Linux programmer.

## About the project
This project is my own interest , It mostly written in C++ with thirdparty libs. It is still in progress but mainly framework worked.
It is developed in order to run on Windows, Linux and Mac platform. So I chose the wxWidgets as UI lib , it also provide threads, file systems.

This program is for file backup. It monitors the directories set by the user and takes appropriate actions. You can perform full synchronous backup or incremental backup without subsequent deletion.
I made this app mainly to save photos and videos of my kids :)
